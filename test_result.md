1. For games with user bets, display the betting line at the time the bet was placed (bet_line)
2. Display the edge at bet time (bet_edge)  
3. Show both bet-time line and closing line for comparison
4. Calculate user bet HIT/MISS based on the bet-time line, not closing line

### Test Scenarios:

#### Backend API Tests:
1. GET /api/opportunities?day=yesterday - Should return games with:
   - user_bet: true/false
   - bet_line: original line when bet was placed
   - bet_edge: edge calculated at bet time
   - user_bet_hit: result based on bet_line

#### Frontend Display Tests:
1. Yesterday's NBA games should show:
   - 🎯 icon next to bet-time line for user bets
   - Closing line in parentheses below bet-time line
   - 🎯 icon next to bet-time edge
   - Closing edge in parentheses below bet-time edge
   - HIT/MISS result based on user's actual bet

### Expected Results for Dec 25 (Christmas Day):
- San Antonio @ Okla City:
  - Bet Line: 233 (closing: 234.5)
  - Bet Edge: +6 (closing: +4.5)
  - Final: 219
  - Result: MISS (219 < 233)

- Houston @ LA Lakers:
  - Bet Line: 230 (closing: 231.5)
  - Bet Edge: +8.5 (closing: +7)
  - Final: 215
  - Result: MISS (215 < 230)

### Incorporate User Feedback:
- None yet

### Testing Protocol:
1. Test backend API returns correct bet_line and bet_edge
2. Test frontend displays bet-time vs closing line correctly
3. Verify HIT/MISS calculation uses bet_line not closing line

## NHL GPG Avg Fix - December 29, 2025

### Issue:
The NHL GPG (Goals Per Game) Averages were using outdated data from `teamrankings.com`. The user requested updated data from:
- **ESPN** (`espn.com/nhl/stats/team`) for Season PPG
- **StatMuse** (`statmuse.com`) for Last 3 Games PPG

### Solution:
Updated all NHL GPG data in `server.py` with freshly scraped values using Playwright:

**Season GPG (from ESPN):**
- Colorado: 3.97 (Rank 1)
- Dallas: 3.49 (Rank 2)
- Edmonton: 3.38 (Rank 3)
- ... through to St. Louis: 2.51 (Rank 32)

**Last 3 Games GPG (from StatMuse):**
- Toronto: 5.00 (Rank 1)
- Vegas: 5.00 (Rank 2)
- Montreal: 4.33 (Rank 3)
- ... through to New Jersey: 1.67 (Rank 32)

### Formula Verified:
`GPG Avg = (SeasonPPG_T1 + SeasonPPG_T2 + Last3PPG_T1 + Last3PPG_T2) / 2`

### Test Results:

#### Sample Calculations Verified:
| Game | Line | GPG Avg | Edge | Rec |
|------|------|---------|------|-----|
| Colorado @ Dallas | 6.5 | 7.4 | +0.9 | OVER |
| Boston @ New Jersey | 5.5 | 4.6 | -0.9 | UNDER |
| Toronto @ Vegas | 6.5 | 8.2 | +1.7 | OVER |
| Tampa Bay @ Florida | 6.0 | 6.7 | +0.7 | OVER |
| Pittsburgh @ Carolina | 6.0 | 7.2 | +1.2 | OVER |
| Ottawa @ Montreal | 6.5 | 7.6 | +1.1 | OVER |

#### Manual Verification:
- **Colorado @ Dallas**: (3.97 + 3.49 + 3.67 + 3.67) / 2 = 7.4 ✓
- **Toronto @ Vegas**: (3.26 + 3.17 + 5.00 + 5.00) / 2 = 8.2 ✓
- **Boston @ New Jersey**: (3.10 + 2.71 + 1.67 + 1.67) / 2 = 4.6 ✓

### Files Modified:
- `/app/backend/server.py`:
  - Updated NHL GPG data at line ~5120 (8pm job function)
  - Updated NHL GPG data at line ~6948 (refresh_nhl_opportunities function)
  - Updated add_nhl_manual_data function to use default GPG values when no gpg_data provided

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Recommendation:** NHL GPG Avg calculation is now working correctly with updated data from ESPN and StatMuse.
