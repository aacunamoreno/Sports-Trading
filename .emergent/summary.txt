        3.  Use  to test the endpoint directly from the terminal to isolate the problem from the frontend: 404 page not found.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Fixing this will enable the system to automatically notify the user of any bet placed on their account from any device, fulfilling a key user requirement.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
-   There are no multi-step tasks currently in progress. The focus is on fixing the pending issue.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    1.  **Test the Chrome Extension (P0):** Guide the user to test the fully created and installed Chrome extension by placing a real bet. This is the primary solution for automated bet placement.
    2.  **Verify Bet Monitoring (P1):** After fixing the Not Found error, guide the user to test the monitoring feature by placing a bet from their mobile phone and confirming a Telegram notification is received.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Full-Stack Betting Dashboard:** A functional UI and backend API were created from scratch.
-   **American Odds Integration:** The system was updated to handle and display American odds format.
-   **Manual Bet Recording:** A feature was added to allow the user to manually log bets into the system. This was a successful pivot when full automation was blocked.
-   **Chrome Browser Extension:** A complete Chrome extension was developed to perform client-side automation, bypassing server-side JavaScript execution issues.
-   **Telegram Notification System:** A robust notification system was integrated, allowing the user to configure a Telegram bot and receive alerts.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Server-Side Playwright Fails to Render JavaScript**
    -   **Description:** The core automation logic, running via Playwright on the server, consistently fails to see the list of games on . This is due to the site's heavy reliance on dynamic JavaScript/AJAX to load content, which does not execute correctly in the server's headless browser environment.
    -   **Status:** BYPASSED, NOT FIXED. The issue was not resolved directly; instead, the agent pivoted to a client-side Chrome extension to work around this fundamental environmental limitation.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Playwright for browser automation, APScheduler for scheduled background tasks, In-memory data storage (Python dictionaries).
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS,  for routing.
-   **Automation:** A major architectural pivot from server-side (Playwright on FastAPI) to client-side (Chrome Browser Extension) automation to handle a JavaScript-heavy target site.
-   **Integrations:** Telegram Bot API.

**key DB schema**
-   No database is used. All data (betting rules, bet history, monitoring status) is stored in-memory within the Python  process. This data will be lost upon server restart.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains all backend logic, API endpoints, Playwright automation, and the new  class using APScheduler.
-   : The UI for configuring Telegram and controlling the new Bet Monitoring feature. This is where the user is encountering the error.
-   : Contains the frontend routing, including the route for the  page.
-   : The entire directory contains the source code for the Chrome extension, which is the primary solution for automated bet placement.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The in-memory data storage in  is not persistent. If this application were to be developed further, migrating state (rules, history, configurations) to a proper database like MongoDB would be a critical next step.

**key api endpoints**
-    (POST): Starts the bet monitoring background job. **(Currently Failing)**
-    (POST): Stops the bet monitoring job.
-    (GET): Gets the current status of the monitor.
-    (POST): Saves the Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID.
-    (POST): Records a bet and sends a Telegram notification.
-    (POST): Connects to  using stored credentials.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The primary automation method is now the Chrome Extension.** Server-side Playwright automation was abandoned due to an inability to render the target website's JavaScript. Do not try to fix the server-side automation; focus on the extension and the monitoring feature.
-   **Data is not persistent.** All user-created rules and bet history are stored in-memory on the backend and will be lost on restart.
-   The user has successfully created all the Chrome extension files locally and installed the extension. The next step for automation is to guide the user to test it.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User:** Asks if notifications can be sent for bets placed on a mobile phone, not just the extension. (Request initiated)
2.  **Agent:** Proposes a bet monitoring system to check the Open Bets page periodically. (Implemented)
3.  **User:** Suggests a 30-minute check interval. (Implemented)
4.  **Agent:** Completes implementation and provides a summary.
5.  **User:** Reports Not Found error with a screenshot after the agent added the monitoring feature. (Issue reported)
6.  **Agent:** Debugs the frontend, finds no issues, and restarts the frontend server.
7.  **User:** Reports Still Not found.
8.  **Agent:** Incorrectly assumes the settings page is working and guides the user to click Start Monitoring.
9.  **User:** Reports It still shows Not Found when i click Start Monitoring. (Issue confirmed)
10. **Agent:** Realizes the backend endpoint must be failing and starts debugging.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:**
    -   The Bet Monitoring feature ().
-   **Mocked:**
    -   Server-side bet placement automation. It was replaced by the Chrome extension.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Telegram:** Integrated for notifications via the  library. Requires a user-provided Bot Token and Chat ID.
-   **Playwright:** Used for browser automation in the background monitoring job.

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
-   Test files created: None
-   Known regressions: None

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Website:** 
    -   Username: 
    -   Password: 
-   **Telegram:**
    -   Bot Token: 
    -   Chat ID: 

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent has not yet guided the user to test the primary automation solution: the Chrome extension. After fixing the current Bet Monitoring issue, this should be the next priority.</analysis>
